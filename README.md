# IFSC Classification Report

This repository includes all of the files for my International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) machine learning classification project. 

There are two versions of the final report. 

- For those primarily interested in seeing the data visualizations, analysis, and results of the supervised machine learning models, I recommend viewing the IFSC_Abridge_Report PDF file.
- For those who want to see the full details of how I imported, cleaned, analyzed, visualized, modeled, and tuned the data, I recommend viewing the IFSC Classification Report PDF file.

I have also included the R and Rmd files associated with each respective for those wishing to utilize the code in their own work (if you do so, I would appreciate your acknowledging the repository as your source). 

If you have any comments or critiques, please feel free to let me know via a pull request or via email.
