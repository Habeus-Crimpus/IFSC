## Overview of the Project

**In the upcoming Paris 2024 Olympic Games, competitive rock climbing will be an official event. This report
documents the development of a 95.6% accurate supervised machine learning models to predict whether a given rock climber
should be classified as a contender to win an International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) bouldering
world cup based data taken from 2018 and 2019 IFSC bouldering competitions. Given the similarity between
the IFSC competition structure and that of the Olympic Games, being able to accurately predict the likely
winners of IFSC events will help countries select their team members. The models covered here could also be
implemented to set betting odds for IFSC or Olympics bouldering events.**

## History of the Project

- September 2022: The full report is released. The raw code, RStudio, and PDF formats are available at launch.
- November 2022: An abridged report is released. It summarizes the key findings, retains all visualizations, and discusses the potential impact of the optimal model.
