# IFSC Classification Report

This repository includes all of the files for my International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) machine learning classification project. 

There are two versions of the final report. 
- For those primarily interested in seeing the data visualizations, analysis, and results of the supervised machine learning models, I recommend viewing the IFSC_Abridge_Report file.
- For those who want to see the full details of how I imported, cleaned, analyzed, visualized, modeled, and tuned the data, I recommend viewing the IFS
